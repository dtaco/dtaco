👋 Hello, world! I'm David, an ESL Professor turned Frontend Web Developer and Edtech Software Engineer based in sunny Florida ☀️

🌟 About Me
I'm a passionate language enthusiast with nearly eleven years of experience in the exciting field of ESL/EFL/TESOL education. Having dedicated myself to teaching English as a second language, I've honed my skills in crafting engaging curricula and fostering effective learning environments. However, my insatiable curiosity and love for technology have led me on an exciting transition into the realm of frontend web development and edtech software engineering.

🚀 Transitioning into Tech
As I embark on this new journey, I'm thrilled to combine my expertise in language instruction with my newfound skills in coding and software development. My goal is to create innovative and user-friendly educational tools that empower learners worldwide, breaking down language barriers and fostering a love for learning in the digital age.

💻 Tech Stack & Skills
Frontend development has become my playground, and I thrive on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm proficient in ReactJS for building dynamic user interfaces and Redux for efficient state management. Python is my go-to language for backend development.
