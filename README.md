Hello, world! I'm David Tacoronte, a college professor turned into a web developer (with a side of IT and cybersec, too.)☀️

## 🌟 About Me
I'm a passionate language enthusiast with nearly twelve years of experience in the exciting field of English education. Having dedicated myself to teaching, I've honed my skills in crafting engaging curricula and fostering effective learning environments. However, my curiosity and love for technology have led me to transition into front-end web development and tech.

## 🚀 Transitioning into Tech
On this new journey, I'm thrilled to combine my expertise in English instruction with my newfound skills in coding, software development, and information technology. My goal is simple - to design, create, and maintain.

## 💻 Tech Stack & Skills
